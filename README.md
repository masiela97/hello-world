First Try Repository by Masi
I'm Masi. I use Kodi Krypton a lot. I've found it easier to use builds from different add-ons and wizard repositories. None of them are fully fulfilling for my usage, and I've researched and found that they can be very inconsistent, unstable, unsafe, and time consuming. So I've decided to make my own and I'm learning how to do the basic configurations and codings and as well as anything that relates to it to make my experiences better.
